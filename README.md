CUNY-Books

i started our project as a practice, and you can clone and try it. if you like the starting point we can follow from here.

in Windows just:

1) git clone https://github.com/Asefaw/cuny-books.git

2) cd cuny-books

3) npm start

4) then open http://localhost:3000.

i haven't tried it on linux yet.
